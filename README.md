# meminfo-retrievers
Retrieve live memory information in every language.

I'm learning some languages for fun, and attempting a small, simple program in each language.

They all source /proc/meminfo on Linux x86_64 and display it to the user in a pretty format.

I have only tested on Linux x86_64 5.15 and higher.
